# Web Socket Client Project

## ðŸš€ Introduction

Welcome to my Web Socket Client project! This application is a dynamic platform featuring a real-time leaderboard and settings management, powered by web sockets.

## ðŸ“– Development Journey

Balancing this project with family visiting today for Christmas has been pretty tight!

- **Testing:** I think Unit and Integration Testing would have given me some bonus points ðŸ˜œ.
- **State Management:** Chose Context API over Redux for its simplicity in smaller projects.

## ðŸ’Œ Conclusion

I wish everyone a happy Christmas and a fantastic new year! Excited to discuss this project further.
